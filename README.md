# Digital-Modulation-Schemes
In a digital communication system, the source to be transmitted is discrete both in time and amplitude. Digital information carrying signals must be first converted
to an analog waveform prior to transmission.At the receiving end, analog signals are converted back to a digital format before presentation to the end user.The conversion process at the transmitting end is known as
modulation.The receiving end is known as demodulation or detection.
There are many types of digital modulation techniques and also their combinations, depending upon the need.
